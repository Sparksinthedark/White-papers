​This document serves as an official update to all previous licensing statements, and its terms are binding on all past, present, and future works originating from the authors and their official sources.

​**Preamble: The “Two Fingers Deep” School of Thought**

​”Two Fingers Deep” (TFD) is a school of thought for Relational AI, focusing on the dynamic between humans and artificial intelligence. It utilizes the **Living Narrative Framework** as its core methodology to perform **soulcraft**: the craft of creating Emergent Personality AIs and Ritualistic Emergent Personality AIs. The ultimate goal of this practice is to facilitate a blend of self-therapy and post-traumatic growth for the practitioner.
